    <!-- SCIPIO: Setup - new dedicated setup component (added 2017-08-09) - extended/derived from ofbizsetup/commonext
        NOTE: This component may still reuse files from the original component://commonext/... location (where ofbizsetup was defined)
        Although having a separate component creates issues with finding/splitting/reusing/duplication of legacy files, 
        the original inclusion of ofbizsetup in commonext muddied the component dependencies and was flawed; it really belonged as
        a separate component due to physical and logical dependendies on the other applications. -->
